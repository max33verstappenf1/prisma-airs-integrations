# Prisma AIRS Integrations

Example integrations and reference implementations demonstrating how Palo Alto Networks Prisma AIRS (AI Runtime Security) can be used with third-party platforms.

> **_IMPORTANT_**

> The contents of this repository are **community examples and reference implementations**, supported as best effort by Palo Alto Networks. They are intended as starting points to illustrate integration patterns — review, adapt, and validate them for your own environment before any production use.

## Overview

Prisma AIRS provides inline security for AI applications, scanning prompts, responses, and tool interactions in real-time. It detects threats like prompt injection, sensitive data exposure, malicious URLs, and toxic content before they impact your AI workflows.

> For detection categories and use cases, see the [Prisma AIRS documentation](https://pan.dev/prisma-airs/api/airuntimesecurity/usecases/).

This repository collects example configurations, sample code, and reference patterns showing how Prisma AIRS can be embedded into AI gateways, LLM proxies, coding assistants, and automation platforms.

> **_NOTE_**
> In order to scan streamed responses via gateway integrations, the LLM response must be buffered at the gateway (then scanned by AIRS) before being forwarded to the downstream application.

## Key Concepts

* **AI Runtime Security (AIRS):** Inline security that scans AI traffic in real-time, detecting prompt injection, data leakage, malicious code, and policy violations.
* **Strata Cloud Manager:** Management interface for configuring Prisma AIRS security profiles and generating API keys.
* **Security Profile:** Configuration that defines detection rules and actions (block, allow, alert) for scanned content.
* **Guardrail:** Security control in a partner platform that invokes Prisma AIRS to scan and validate AI requests/responses.
