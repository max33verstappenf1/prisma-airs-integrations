-- request-callout :: config.upstream.by_lua
--
-- Runs BEFORE the upstream request is made, in the access phase -- which is the
-- whole reason enforcement is possible here at all. The Kong PDK permits
-- kong.response.exit WITH A BODY only in preread, rewrite, access and
-- admin_api; there is no response-phase hook in this policy that could reject
-- anything. So this is the single enforcement point.
--
-- WHY A JSON-RPC ERROR AND NOT A BARE 403. An MCP client that receives a bare
-- HTTP 403 sees a transport failure, and several SDKs tear the session down on
-- one. A JSON-RPC error object carrying the caller's OWN request id is a tool
-- failure: the client surfaces it against the call that caused it, and the
-- session survives, so one blocked tool call does not end the conversation.
--
-- The HTTP status is 403 to match Kong's own MCP denials, which follow the MCP
-- 2025-11-25 authorization specification from AI Gateway 3.14 onward. The
-- JSON-RPC codes match PANW's v3 Kong plugin exactly -- -32001 for a policy
-- block, -32003 for the scanner being unavailable -- so a client that has
-- learned one Prisma AIRS integration has learned both.
