"""Inline the Lua under lua/ into the policy YAML under config/, emitting dist/.

Why this exists. Kong wants the guardrail functions and the callout hooks as
quoted strings inside the policy config. Lua living only inside a YAML string is
Lua nobody lints, nobody unit-tests, and nobody reviews line by line -- which is
how a security control ends up with an untested branch in the one function that
decides whether traffic passes. So the Lua lives in real .lua files that
spec/ exercises and luacheck reads, and this script assembles the artefact that
is actually applied.

    scripts/build-config.py            rebuild dist/ from config/ + lua/
    scripts/build-config.py --check    fail if dist/ is stale (for a pipeline)

A marker is the whole value of a YAML key:

    airs_verdict: "__INLINE__lua/guardrail/airs_verdict.lua"

and is replaced by a literal block scalar carrying that file, indented to match.

Placeholders of the form __AIRS_SOMETHING__ inside an inlined file are filled
from the `params:` block of the policy the marker sits in -- a callout by_lua
has no documented way to read its own policy config, so the values are pinned
at build time and the YAML stays the single place an operator edits them.
